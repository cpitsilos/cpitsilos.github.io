    <h1>Type by Tape (Through Time)</h1>

<div class="post">
  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://typeforce.com" title="Typeforce">Typeforce</a> is an annual showcase of emerging typographic artists in Chicago. Nearly 1,000 people poured though the doors of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coprosperity.org" title="Co-Prosperity Sphere">Co-Prosperity Sphere</a>, Chicago’s experimental cultural centre, for the opening night of Typeforce 4.</p>

  <p>We wanted to explore interactivity and human curiosity by creating an installation using analogue materials. At the start of the evening, our piece began as a large, empty wall with solid and dashed lines. Attendees were given rolls of blue tape and were invited to cover the dashed lines. Some tore off the smallest piece of tape. Others attempted to cover an entire section of the wall.</p>

  <p>As the night progressed, we watched the party work together to solve the puzzle. For hours, it inspired conversation and encouraged thoughtful examination. When the last dashed line was taped, the message was clear. “Nothing cannot exist forever.” –Stephen Hawking.</p>
