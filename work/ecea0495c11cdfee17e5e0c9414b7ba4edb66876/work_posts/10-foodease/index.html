    <h1>Foodease</h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>Foodease is a restaurant and market opened by Lettuce Entertain You restaurant group. Located in the heart of the Magnificent Mile at Water Tower Place, it features food prepared to-go, made from scratch cooking, and showcases favorite dishes from iconic Chicago restaurants.</p>

  <p>The Foodease brand is casual and fun. Categories like Lunch@YourDesk and Quick Dinners function as a playful way to organize items for customers dining in or on their lunch break. The team worked through construction, choosing materials and design solutions for the space. A simple visual system was created to account for daily changes to the menus and product selection. Every morning, panels are put up at the entrance informing guests of the restaurants featured that day. Light colors and a minimal typeface provide legibility and approachability. The identity was created to allow the ingredients to be the stars.</p>
