    <h1>Close Your Rings</h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>After the original Apple Watch went on sale in 2015, one of its standout uses quickly became health tracking.</p>

  <p>The Close Your Rings page shares effective ways that Apple Watch wearers can live a healthier and more active lifestyle by completing one simple goal each day. It also highlights new health features found in watchOS 4, including monthly activity challenges, new award animations, and a redesigned workout app.</p>

  <p>The upbeat design of the page takes cues from the Apple Watch interface. It is separated out into sections named after the rings: Move, Exercise, Stand. A vibrant system of cards was created to share and organize different features of the Apple Watch and facts about health and fitness.</p>

  <p>The page is ever evolving with new information, tips, and encouragement to close your rings and live a healthier life.</p>
